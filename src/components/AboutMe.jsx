      <p>Hi! My name is Tucker, and welcome to my portfolio.  I have been on this coding journey for about 6 months and I am extremely proud to show off the progress I have made. I was completely new at this whem I started, if you can believe it.  Outside of coding, I am a huge fan of heavy music.  Especially the -core genres like Metalcore, Deathcore, Hardcore, etc.  I'm also a huge nerd who loves video games and playing Dungeons and Dragons with friends.  </p>
